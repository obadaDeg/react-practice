# Refs and Portals

## Refs vs State

### State:
1. Causes the component to re-evaluate (re-execute) when changed.
2. Should be used for values that are directly reflected in the UI, such as:
   - Button click counts.
   - Form input values (if part of the controlled component logic).
   - Visibility toggles (e.g., showing or hiding a modal).
3. Should **not** be used for "behind-the-scenes" values that have no impact on the UI, as frequent state updates can negatively affect performance by triggering unnecessary re-renders.

### Refs:
1. Do **not** cause component re-evaluation when changed, making them ideal for scenarios where performance is critical.
2. Can be used to gain direct access to DOM elements, which is helpful for:
   - Focus management (e.g., focusing an input field on load).
   - Scrolling logic (e.g., scrolling to a specific element).
   - Reading and manipulating DOM properties directly (e.g., getting the width or height of an element).
3. Are also suitable for storing mutable values that don’t need to trigger re-renders, such as:
   - Previous state or props values.
   - Timer IDs in `setTimeout` or `setInterval`.

## Refs Use Cases

1. **Beyond DOM Element Connections:**  
   Refs can manage non-UI-related behaviors that require persistence between renders without causing re-renders.  
   **Example:**  
   In this project, refs were used to start and stop a challenge timer without affecting other challenges. By storing the timer ID in a ref, the component logic remained clean and performant.

2. **Persistent Mutable Values:**  
   - Ideal for values like:
     - Animation frame IDs when working with `requestAnimationFrame`.
     - Caching data that doesn't need to trigger updates (e.g., keeping track of a current slide in a carousel).
     - Keeping track of a previous value for comparison purposes (e.g., "previous count" in counter logic).

3. **Improving Performance in Event Handlers:**  
   - Use refs to store data that’s frequently accessed in event listeners to avoid unnecessary re-renders caused by state dependencies.

4. **Accessing Child Components:**  
   - Use `React.forwardRef` to allow parent components to access methods or properties of child components, enabling custom interactions.

## Portals

### What Are Portals?
Portals provide a way to render children into a different part of the DOM tree while preserving the React context. This allows components to maintain functionality and state while being visually placed outside their parent DOM hierarchy.

### Use Cases:
1. **Modals and Dialogs:**  
   Render modal content into a separate DOM node to ensure it's not constrained by the parent component's styling or layout.
2. **Tooltips and Popovers:**  
   Keep tooltips correctly positioned and free from overflow issues by rendering them outside of the parent container.
3. **Overlays and Notifications:**  
   Manage overlays that require full-screen coverage or need to stay on top of all other UI elements.

### Implementation Example:
```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const Modal = ({ isOpen, children }) => {
  if (!isOpen) return null;

  return ReactDOM.createPortal(
    <div className="modal">{children}</div>,
    document.getElementById('modal-root') // Ensure this element exists in the HTML
  );
};
```

# Hooks Summary

### 1. **useRef**  
   - Creates a mutable reference object that persists across renders.
   - Common Use Cases:
     - Accessing and manipulating DOM elements directly.
     - Storing mutable values that don’t require re-renders (e.g., timer IDs, previous props/state values).

#### Example:
```jsx
function InputFocus() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleFocus = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
      <button onClick={handleFocus}>Focus Input</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### 2. **useImperativeHandle**  
   - Allows custom control over the instance value exposed when using `React.forwardRef`.
   - Useful for creating a controlled interface for components accessed via refs.

#### Example:
```jsx
import React, { useRef, useImperativeHandle, forwardRef } from 'react';

const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focus: () => inputRef.current.focus(),
  }));

  return <input ref={inputRef} {...props} />;
});

function Parent() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleClick = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <CustomInput ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus Input</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

# Additional Topics

### Why Avoid Overusing Refs
- While refs are powerful, overusing them can lead to unmanageable or "imperative" code that doesn’t follow React’s declarative nature.
- State should always be preferred when the value affects the UI or requires updates.

### Combining Portals and Context
- Portals preserve React context, making them compatible with context-based features like themes or authentication states. This simplifies managing application-wide settings in portal-based components.
```jsx
<ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
  <App />
  {ReactDOM.createPortal(<Modal />, document.getElementById('portal-root'))}
</ThemeContext.Provider>
```
